🎬 Ish Movie Ticket Pipeline
🎯 Objective

To design and implement a complete automated DevOps workflow for a web-based movie ticket booking application, covering:

Version Control

Containerization

Continuous Integration (CI)

Continuous Delivery (CD)

Deployment & Orchestration

using Git, Docker, Jenkins, and Kubernetes.

🛠️ Tools and Technologies Used
Tool	Purpose
Git & GitHub	Version control and code management
Docker	Containerization of the web application
Jenkins	Automation of build, test, and deployment pipeline
Docker Hub	Repository for Docker images
Kubernetes	Container orchestration and scaling
⚙️ Workflow Overview

The pipeline consists of 4 main stages:

Version Control (Git & GitHub)

Containerization (Docker)

Continuous Integration & Delivery (Jenkins)

Deployment and Orchestration (Kubernetes)

Each stage is automated to ensure smooth delivery from development to deployment.

🔹 Step 1: Version Control and Branching

Initialized a Git repository for the application.

Implemented GitFlow branching strategy:

main → Production code

develop → Integration branch

feature/* → Feature-specific branches

Pushed the code to GitHub regularly.

🔹 Step 2: Containerization (Docker)

Created a Dockerfile to containerize the web application.

Built and tested the Docker image locally.

Verified successful build and container execution.

🔹 Step 3: Continuous Integration & Delivery (Jenkins)

Configured Jenkins for an automated pipeline:

Code Checkout from GitHub

Docker Build

Push Image to Docker Hub

Deploy to Kubernetes

Integrated Jenkins with GitHub webhooks to trigger builds automatically.

Verified successful pipeline execution in Jenkins console.

🔹 Step 4: Deployment and Orchestration (Kubernetes)

Defined Kubernetes Deployment and Service YAML manifests.

Deployed the app using kubectl apply -f <file>.

Verified running pods and services via kubectl get all.

Scaled application replicas to handle more load.
